To create the documentation for a component, 
you have to create a markdown file with the same name in the same folder as the component.
Example:
    Footer/
        Footer.jsx              << Component
        Footer.md               << Documentation example
        Footer.test.jsx         << Test of the component


----

The documentation file is markdown, and it can contains code example.

Situation A, with code showcase. The code will be highlighted and display as given.
```js static
<Footer />
```

Situation B, with live example. The code will be renderer by Styleguidist in React, but without any way to control the rendering.
New import (like 'import Name from 'name') doesn't work.
```js noeditor
<Footer />
```
TODO: currently 'reduxAsyncConnect' is blocking some components to render live
