# Introduction to Volto

Volto is a React-based frontend for content management systems (CMS), currently
supporting three backend implementations: Plone, Guillotina and a NodeJS
reference implementation.

Plone is a CMS built on Python born back in 2001, and unmatched experience in
the subject.

Plone has very interesting features that are still appealing to developers and
users alike as customizable content types, hierarchical URL object traversing
and a complex content workflow powered by a granular permissions model that
allows you to build from simple websites to complex huge intranets.

Volto exposes all that features and communicates with Plone via its mature REST
API. It has the ability of being highly themable and customizable.

Volto also supports other APIs like Guillotina, a Python resource management
system, which is inspired on Plone using the same basic concepts like
traversal, content types and permissions model.

Last but not least, it also supports a Volto Nodejs-based backend reference API
implementation that demos how other systems could also use Volto to display and
create content through it.

As any CMS, Volto is capable of take care of Server Side Rendering (SSR) in
order to support SEO.
