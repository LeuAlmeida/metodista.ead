## Introduction

[Volto](https://github.com/plone/volto) is a React-based frontend for content
management systems, currently supporting three backend implementations: Plone,
Guillotina and a NodeJS reference implementation.

[Plone](https://plone.org) is a CMS built on Python with over 17 years of experience.

Plone has very interesting features that appeal to developers and users alike,
such as customizable content types, hierarchical URL object traversing and a
sophisticated content workflow powered by a granular permissions model. This
allows you to build anything from simple websites to enterprise-grade
intranets.

Volto exposes all these features and communicates with Plone via its
mature [REST API](https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi). Volto has the
ability of being highly themable and customizable.

Volto also supports other APIs like [Guillotina](https://guillotina.io/), a
Python resource management system, inspired by Plone and using the same basic
concepts like traversal, content types and permissions model.

Last but not least, it also supports a [Volto Nodejs-based backend reference](https://github.com/plone/volto-reference-backend) API implementation that
demos how other systems could also use Volto to display and create content
through it.

## Quick Start

First get all the requirements installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js LTS (10.x)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python 2.7.x](https://python.org/) or
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (if using the Plone/Guillotina docker images)

### Create Volto App

Create a new Volto project by using the `create-volto-app` utility.

It will bootstrap a Volto project in a folder of your choice with all the required
boilerplate to start customizing your Volto site.

    $ npm install -g yarn
    $ npm install -g @plone/create-volto-app
    $ create-volto-app myvoltoproject
    $ cd myvoltoproject

Although we install and use `yarn`, the `create-volto-app` tool still needs to be
installed using `npm -g` because `yarn` has a different implementation of
global installs.

### Bootstrap the Plone API backend

We recommend Plone as backend of choice for Volto.

You can bootstrap a ready Docker Plone container with all the dependencies and ready for Volto use:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 kitconcept/plone.restapi:latest
```

or as an alternative if you have experience with Plone and you have all the
dependencies installed on your system, you can use the supplied buildout in the
`api` folder by issuing the command:

```shell
$ make build-backend
```

### Start Volto

Once inside your Volto project folder:

```shell
$ yarn start
```

### Browsing

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Demo

You can try a Volto online demo in [https://volto.kitconcept.com](https://volto.kitconcept.com)

## Documentation

You can find the (beta) documentation in [http://docs.voltocms.com](http://docs.voltocms.com)

## Training

A detailed training on how to create your own website using Volto is available
as part of the Plone training docs at [https://training.plone.org/5/volto/index.html](https://training.plone.org/5/volto/index.html).

[Timo Stollenwerk - Reinventing Plone, Roadmap to the Modern Web](https://2018.ploneconf.org/talks/reinventing-plone-roadmap-to-the-modern-web)

## Browser support

Volto works well with any modern (and updated) browser, including their mobile
flavors: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.

We do not guarantee that browsers who were deprecated by their vendors (e.g. Internet Explorer 11) will be supported by Volto in the future.


## Volto Development

For Volto development you need all the requirements already mentioned on the
[Quick Start](#quick-start) section.

### Checkout the Volto repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/plone/volto.git
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
$ yarn
```

### Install a backend

#### Plone (recommended)

Either using a Docker image

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 kitconcept/plone.restapi:latest
```

or running Plone on your machine (advanced), additional dependencies might be
required only for Plone experienced integrators/developers. Check the [Plone
Installation Documentation](https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installation.html).

```shell
$ cd api
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```
#### Guillotina (experimental)

It still doesn't support the full API/features that Plone provides.

```shell
$ docker-compose -f g-api/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Run frontend

```shell
$ yarn start
```

### Browsing

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Testing

```shell
$ yarn test
```

### Releasing

For ease the release process, a package that helps with the process is
installed: `release-it`.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it

For using it and start a release you need to fulfill the requirements:

- Have permissions to push on master branch
- Have permissions on the @plone org on npmjs.com
- Have a environment variable (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) with a GitHub personal token to
  write the Release page on GitHub (https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it#github-releases)

Then the command for release:

```shell
$ yarn release
```

a dry-release command for testing the output is also available:

```shell
$ yarn dry-release
```

### Acceptance testing

Volto uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for browser-based acceptance testing.

Run acceptance tests (with the Plone backend):

```shell
$ yarn ci:cypress:run
```

Run acceptance tests (with the Guillotina backend):

```shell
$ yarn ci:cypress:run:guillotina
```

#### Writing new acceptance tests

When writing new acceptance tests you usually want to minimize the time it takes to run the tests.

To do so, start three individual terminal sessions for running the Plone backend, the Volto frontend and the acceptance tests.

Start the Plone backend:

```shell
$ yarn ci:start-api-plone
```

Start the Volto frontend:

```shell
$ RAZZLE_API_PATH=http://localhost:55001/plone yarn start
```

Open Cypress to run and develop the acceptance tests:

```shell
$ yarn cypress:open
```

Go to the `cypress/integration` folder to see existing tests.
This directory is hot reloaded with your changes as you write the tests. For more information on how to write Cypress tests:

    https://docs.cypress.io

#### Running the acceptance tests with Guillotina backend

If you want to use Guillotina as backend to run the tests you should run:

```shell
$ yarn ci:start-api-plone-guillotina
```
