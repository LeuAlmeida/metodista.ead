# Upgrade Guide

This upgrade guide lists all breaking changes in Volto and explains the
 steps that are necessary to upgrade to the lastest version.

!!! note
    There are times that updating the Volto boilerplate (the one generated by
    `@plone/create-volto-app`) is enough to fulfill all the changes. If you
    haven't heavilly modified it, moving things around and copying over your
    dependencies might do when dealing with upgrades. We keep the generator up
    to date and in sync with current Volto release.

## Upgrading to Volto 3.x

Volto was upgraded to use Razzle 3.0.0 which is not a breaking change itself,
but it forces to some changes in the boilerplate on your Volto projects. You
should change the babel config by deleting .babelrc file and creating a new
file `babel.config.js` with these contents:

```js
module.exports = require('@plone/volto/babel');
```

Then update your `package.json` to Volto 3.x.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@plone/volto": "3.0.0",
    ...
  }
```

Volto 3.x is compatible with the new changes introduced in the vocabularies
endpoint in plone.restapi 4.0.0. If you custom build a widget based in the
Volto ones, you should update them as well. Volto updated its own widget set to
support them:

- `components/manage/Widgets/ArrayWidget`
- `components/manage/Widgets/SelectWidget`
- `components/manage/Widgets/TokenWidget`

They all use `react-select` third party library for render it.

## Upgrading to Volto 2.x

### Improved Tiles HOC

The Tiles HOC (High Order Component) was changed to lift off some of the
features from the tiles themselves and now it takes care of them by its own.

- The delete tile feature was moved to it
- The keylisteners for navigating through tiles was moved to it
- The properties passed down to the tiles are improved and documented

This change only applies to your existing tiles, you have to update them
accordingly by delete the trash icon and action from the end of your tiles

```js
{this.props.selected && (
  <Button
    icon
    basic
    onClick={() => this.props.onDeleteTile(this.props.tile)}
    className="tile-delete-button"
  >
    <Icon name={trashSVG} size="18px" />
  </Button>
)}
```

Modify the parent element of your tile making this changes:

```js
<div
  role="presentation"
  onClick={() => this.props.onSelectTile(this.props.tile)}
  className={cx('tile hero', {
    selected: this.props.selected,
  })}
  tabIndex={0}
  onKeyDown={e =>
    this.props.handleKeyDown(
      e,
      this.props.index,
      this.props.tile,
      this.node
    )
  }
  ref={node => {
    this.node = node;
  }}
>
```

- Add the keylisteners to the parent element of your tile

```js
  onKeyDown={e =>
    this.props.handleKeyDown(
      e,
      this.props.index,
      this.props.tile,
      this.node
    )
  }
```

- Add a ref to it and assign it to `this.node`.

```js
  ref={node => {
    this.node = node;
  }}
```

- Add a proper role for it

```js
  role="presentation"
```

Take a look into the implementation of the default Volto tiles to get a grasp
on all the edge cases related to keyboard navigation and how to deal with them.

### Reordering of the internal CSS, added an extra

The internal Volto CSS has been tidied up and reordered, for that reason, some
other extras have been introduced and the theme.config in your project needs to
be updated by making sure you have these two extras in the
`theme.config` file:

```less
/* Extras */
@main        : 'pastanaga';
@custom      : 'pastanaga';
```
